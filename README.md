 ABSTRACT 

E-Healthcare and Encrypted PHRs 

• E-healthcare enables high-quality medical services through encrypted personal healthcare data (PHRs). 

• Encrypted PHRs reduce data usage and require constant online presence for clinicians. 

• Proposed proxy searchable re-encryption strategy for remote patient health record monitoring. 

• Medi Connect ensures patient privacy and confidentiality by encrypting healthcare records before uploading to a cloud server. 

• Only authorized doctors or research institutions have access to PHRs. 

• Doctor-in-charge can delegate medical research and utilization via cloud server. 

• Security and efficiency of the scheme are formalized and evaluated.
